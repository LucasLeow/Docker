== 1 Intro to Docker ==
    - Creates containers to run apps / servers in isolated environment
        - Node app (app server)
        - React app (app server)
        - MongoDB (db server)
        etc.

    -- Significance in team development --
        - developer 1 making app in NodeJS environment
            - node version 17
            - relevant environment variables
            - dependencies / runtime env
            etc.
    
        - dev. 1 push everything into Docker container
        - dev. 1 can pass container to other devs
        - other devs install required content in container
        (Save a lot of set-up time)

    - Docker:
        - tool for creating / managing containers
        - Containers are also easier to push to production server
            - don't need to configure server, already within container


    -- Container vs VMs --
        - VM
            - has own full OS
            - typically slower

        - Containers
            - share host's OS (less bloated)
            - typically quicker
            - more lightweight
    
        - depend on use case, sometimes VM may also be better
